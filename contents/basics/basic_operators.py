print(number)

remainder = 11 % 3
print(remainder)


squared = 7 ** 2
cubed = 2 ** 3
print(squared)
print(cubed)

#Operators with Strings
helloworld = "hello" + " " + "world"
print(helloworld)

lotsofhellos = "hello" * 10
print(lotsofhellos)

#Operators with Lists
even_numbers = [2,4,6,8]
odd_numbers = [1,3,5,7]
all_numbers = odd_numbers + even_numbers
print(all_numbers)

print([1,2,3] * 3)

#"not" and "is" operators
print(not False) # Prints out True
print((not False) == (False)) # Prints out False
print((not True) is (False)) # Prints out Tue
